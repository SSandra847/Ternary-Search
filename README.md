# Ternary-Search
 Ternary Search in C

This code a a simple recursive ternary search function in C. A ternary search is a searching technique that is used to determine 
the position of a specific value in an array. In binary search, the sorted array is divided into two parts while in ternary search, 
it is divided into  parts and then you determine in which part the element exists. It seems this search does less number of comaprisons 
as it makes Log3n recursive calls, but binary search makes Log2n recursive calls.
